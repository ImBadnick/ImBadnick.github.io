            <p> WORTH is the abbreviation for WORkTogetHer and is a project done for an university exam. The goal of this educational project is the organization and management of projects in a collaborative way.
                The project has been done in Java. </p>
            <h3> PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>
                In recent years, numerous collaborative applications have been created, for sharing content,
                messaging, video conferencing, project management, etc. In this educational project, WORTH
                (WORkTogetHer), we will focus on organizing and managing projects in a collaborative way. The
                collaboration and project management applications (eg Trello, Asana) help people get organized and
                coordinate in carrying out common projects. These can be professional projects, or in
                in general, any activity can be organized into a series of tasks (eg to do list) which are carried out by
                members of a group: the applications of interest are of different types, think of the organization of a
                software development project with colleagues from the development team, but also to organize a party
                with a group of friends. <br>
                Some of these tools (eg Trello) implement the Kanban method (sign or billboard, in
                Japanese), an “agile” management method. The Kanban board provides an overview of the activities e
                displays its evolution, for example from creation and subsequent progress to completion,
                after the review phase has been successfully passed. One person from the work group can take
                in charge of an activity when he has the opportunity, by moving the activity on the board. <br>
                The project consists in the implementation of WORkTogetHer (WORTH): a tool for managing
                collaborative projects inspired by some principles of the Kanban methodology.

            <h3> SPECIFICATION OF OPERATIONS</h3>
            <p>
                Users can access WORTH after registration and login.
                In WORTH, a project, identified by a unique name, consists of a series of "cards" ("cards"), which
                they represent the tasks to be carried out in order to complete it, and it provides a series of services. For every project
                is associated with a list of members, that is users who have the permissions to modify the cards and access the
                services associated with the project (eg chat). <br>
                A card consists of a name and a text description. The name assigned to the card must be
                unique within a project. Each project has four associated lists that define the flow of
                work as a passage of cards from one list to the next: TODO, INPROGRESS, TOBEREVISED, DONE.
                Any member of the project can move the card from one list to another. <br>
                The newly created cards are automatically added to the TODO list. Any member can move one
                card from one list to another. When all the cards are in the DONE list the project can be deleted, from
                any member participating in the project. <br>
                A group chat is associated with each project, and all members of that project, if online (after having
                logged in), they can receive and send messages on the chat. On the chat the system also sends
                automatically notifications of events related to the movement of a project card from a list
                to the other. <br>
                Un utente registrato e dopo login eseguita con successo ha i permessi per:
                <ul>
                    <li>Retrieve the list of all users registered to the service;</li>
                    <li>Retrieve the list of all users registered for the service and connected to the service (in online status);</li>
                    <li>Create a project;</li>
                    <li>Retrieve the list of projects of which he is a member.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                A user who has created a project automatically becomes a member of it. Can add other users
                register as a member of the project. All project members have the same rights (the creator himself is
                a member like the others), in particular:
                <ul>
                    <li>add other users registered as project members;</li>
                    <li> retrieve the list of project members;</li>
                    <li>create cards in the project;</li>
                    <li>retrieve the list of cards associated with a project;</li>
                    <li>retrieve the information of a specific card of the project;</li>
                    <li>recover the “history” of a specific card of the project (see below for details);</li>
                    <li>move any card of the project</li>
                    <li>send a message on the project chat;</li>
                    <li>read messages from the group chat;</li>
                    <li>delete the project.</li>
                </ul> 
                </p>
                <p>
                The operations offered by the service are specified below. During implementation it is possible
                add additional parameters as needed.
